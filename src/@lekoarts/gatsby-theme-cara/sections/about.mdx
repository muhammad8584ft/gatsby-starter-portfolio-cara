> Airport Authority Office Region VI - Padang was formed based on Minister of Transportation Regulation Number PM 41 dated 31 March 2011 concerning Organization and Work Procedures of Airport Authority Offices.

Airport Authority Office VI - Padang was formed because every year the number of passenger movements and aircraft movements continues to increase in the Padang Region and its surroundings. Especially before long holidays and national holidays. Where there was a surge in the number of passengers who packed the terminal and the number of flights increased. So that more intensive supervision is needed from the Aviation Authority in order to maintain flight safety, security and comfort.
